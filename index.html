    Schizophrenia
    <div class="service-article" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>Symptons of Schizophrenia:</strong><br>
Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder that affects a person’s thinking, perception, emotions, and behavior. It often interferes with the ability to distinguish between reality and imagination. Common symptoms include hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not real), delusions, disorganized speech or behavior, social withdrawal, and reduced emotional expression.
Early recognition and treatment play a crucial role in improving long-term outcomes. Families should approach the individual with patience, avoid confrontation over beliefs, and provide emotional support. Encouraging medication adherence and regular follow-ups is essential. If symptoms such as suspiciousness, hearing voices, or sudden behavioral changes appear, consulting a psychiatrist promptly is strongly recommended. With proper treatment and family support, many individuals can lead stable and meaningful lives. 
        </p>     
      <p><strong>Treatment Approach:</strong> At our clinic, we offer comprehensive care including medication management, psychotherapy, and support for daily functioning. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to improving outcomes.</p>

    Depression
    <div class="service-article" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>Symptons of Depression:</strong> <br> 
        Depression is more than temporary sadness; it is a serious mood disorder that affects daily functioning, thoughts, and physical health. Symptoms may include persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities, fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating.
Patients often hesitate to seek help, but early treatment can significantly reduce suffering. Family members should listen without judgment, offer reassurance, and avoid minimizing the person’s feelings. Encouraging professional help is important, especially if symptoms persist for more than two weeks or include thoughts of self-harm. A psychiatrist can provide appropriate therapy and medication if needed. With timely care, depression is highly treatable, and recovery is possible.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Treatment Approach:</strong> We provide evidence-based treatments like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), antidepressants, and lifestyle counseling to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

    Sexual Problems Treatment
    <div class="service-article" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>Symptons of Sexual Problems:</strong> <br>
        Sexual problems can involve reduced desire, performance difficulties, pain during intercourse, or dissatisfaction, and may arise due to psychological stress, anxiety, medical conditions, or medication side effects. These issues often cause distress and impact relationships and self-esteem.
Open communication and a non-judgmental approach are vital. Patients should understand that sexual concerns are common and treatable. Families or partners should offer emotional support rather than blame. Avoid self-medication or reliance on unverified remedies. Consulting a psychiatrist or specialist helps identify underlying psychological or medical causes and ensures safe, effective treatment. Early professional guidance can restore confidence, improve relationships, and enhance overall well-being.

While occasional anxiety is normal, ongoing symptoms require attention. Patients should be encouraged to seek help rather than avoid situations or rely on temporary coping mechanisms. Families can help by offering reassurance, understanding triggers, and avoiding pressure or criticism. Consulting a psychiatrist is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. With proper therapy, medication, and lifestyle guidance, anxiety disorders can be effectively managed and quality of life significantly improved.

Recovery requires professional support and a structured treatment plan. Families play a key role by offering encouragement, setting healthy boundaries, and avoiding blame or enabling behavior. De-addiction treatment often includes medical supervision, counseling, and relapse-prevention strategies. Consulting a psychiatrist early helps reduce complications and improves recovery outcomes.

        Headaches can range from mild tension headaches to severe migraines and may be triggered by stress, sleep issues, anxiety, or underlying medical conditions. Symptoms include head pain, sensitivity to light or sound, nausea, and difficulty concentrating.
Frequent or severe headaches should not be self-treated repeatedly with painkillers alone. Patients should monitor patterns and triggers.
